# Video-outputting-pix-by-pix-algorythm
This is the algorithm that I used in the video (https://youtu.be/KFzoTJxtwVo?si=efPzK9w0VnPKB8S6) to output a pixel-by-pixel animation for each frame. The algorithm is designed for two-color videos (shadow theater) and works on the principle of turning on/off a virtual object with the properties of a conventional lamp using the mouse cursor.
